<h4>About</h4>
<p>
I am a software engeneering student at the Technion. <br>
This website contains some original material and links to other interesting stuff. I mainly but not exclusively focus on web development, computer security and military technology. My hobbies include reading science fiction books, computer games and philosophy.
Feel free to contact me at:<u> sartium [at] mail.technion.ac.il</u>
