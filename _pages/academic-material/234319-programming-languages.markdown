<h4> ML exam summary page </h4>
<p>
I have made a summary of all examples that appeared in the tutorial, as well as the output they produce. 
This "cheat-sheet" is good if you do not remember how to do X or Y, or if you are asked about an output of an ML statement. 
You can download the sml file from here: <a href="files/exam_summary.sml" alt="Exam cheat-sheet">exam_summary.sml</a>.

<h4> Editors for Prolog and ML </h4>
<p>
There are some options for editing ML. Under windows I have used <a href="http://lacl.univ-paris12.fr/crolard/enseignement/MLEdit/MLEdit.html" alt="Ml Editor">MLEdit-NT</a>, 
which is pretty basic, it has syntax highlighting and allows running ML (assuming SML/NJ is installed) 
programs without leaving the editor. Regarding Linux, I heard that there is an editor installed in SSDL, 
but I never tried it. Instead I used <a href="http://www.smlnj.org/doc/Emacs/sml-mode.html" alt="Information">sml-mode</a> 
for emacs. This can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~monnier/elisp/" alt="Downoad Page">here</a> 
and installed in your home directory.
<br>
For prolog under windows I suggest <a href="http://lakk.bildung.hessen.de/netzwerk/faecher/informatik/swiprolog/indexe.html" alt="SWI Prolog Editor">SWI Prolog Editor</a>. More IDE's can be found on the <a href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/IDE.html" alt="Prolog IDE's"> official SWI-Prolog home page</a>

<h4> Aggregating your homework solution files </h4>
<p>
Usually you will be required to solve several unrelated questions, but submit only one (or two) file. 
When I did the course, my methodology was to create a separate file for each question. After I have wrote the code, I run a simple  
aggregation script to merge all questions into a single file. 
You can download a simple windows batch file that does this from <a href="files/aggregate.cmd" alt="aggregate.cmd"> here (aggregate.bat)</a>. Hopefully it will save you some time.
