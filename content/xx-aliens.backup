Instead of asking the question of why aliens have not made contact with us yet, let's look at the problem from a different angle. Why would an alien civilization make contatc with us?

* Research - 
* Curiousity - 
* Earth's Resources - 
* Expansion - 
* Enslavemnt - 

For a sufficently advanced spieces, humans and human civilizartion as a whole would be analagous to mold groing in a cave in the dessert. We don't send research expiditions to this mold, we don't try to communicate with it and the chances of accidently running it over with a dozer are slim.
