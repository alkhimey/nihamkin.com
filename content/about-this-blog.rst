Welcome!
--------

My name is Artium Nihamkin and I am a software engineer from Israel.

This is my personal blog where I plan to publish interesting and useful stuff
that I encounter during my endeavor in my professional and personal life.

Some of the things you might find here are:

1. Articles related to software developer.
2. Problems and solutions for various technical problems that I have personally encountered.
3. Philosophical monologues.
4. Discoveries in the world of hobby robotics.
5. Links to interesting information in other blogs.

I do not expect people to follow my blog closely. My expectations are that
individual posts will be discovered through various google searches.
