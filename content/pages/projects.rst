This page is dedicated to differnet hobbyist projects I run throught the years. 

Since I am a software engineer, most of these projects are software related.

Other projects too small to be important can be found on my `Github page`_.

Linux Kernek Modules with Ada
==============================

- **Year:** 2016-2018
- **Source:** https://github.com/alkhimey/Ada_Kernel_Module_Toolkit

My attempt to develop **Linux Kernel Modules** using the **Ada** programming langugage. 

This is a proof of concept that I am still working on. My goal is to demonstrate the usefullness of Ada's strong typing system for this kind of application.

Follow my blog to see how I progress.

CelloWar
==================

- **Description:** An android multiplayer game created during Global Game Jam 2018.
- **Year:** 2017
- **Source:** https://github.com/alex-ilgayev/CelloWar
- **GGJ Page:** https://globalgamejam.org/2018/games/cellowar
- **Partners:** Alex Ilgayev

This is a game that was created during Global Game Jam 2018. We did not use anything beyond what **Android's NDK** provided. All the graphics are drawn on a Canvas. For the game server, we used Tomcat and implemented our own queueing protocol.

Let There be Light
==================

- **Description:** A game created with Construct 2 during Global Game Jam 2017.
- **Year:** 2018
- **Source:** https://github.com/alkhimey/Wave/
- **Demo:** http://ggj17.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/
- **GGJ Page:** http://globalgamejam.org/2017/games/let-there-be-light
- **Partners:** Andrey Smirnov (art), Yuval Neumann (programming), Ben Saban (design).

This game that was created during Global Game Jam 2017. We used **Construct 2** as the game engine.

Moving the mouse up and down will alter the path that the glowing moon is following. The player must guide the moon to touch the glowing orbs, otherwise it will fade and die.

Ada Curve
==========

- **Description:** Drawing splines with OpenGL bindings for Ada.
- **Year:** 2016-2017
- **Source:** https://github.com/alkhimey/Ada_Curve

A little demonstration of different spline constructing algorithms. 
The included algorithms are: De Castelijau (Bezier curves), De Boor (B Splines), Catmull Rom and Lagrange Interpolation (both on equidistant nodes and on Chavyshev nodes).

**Ada** programming language is used and the graphics are done with **OpenGL** bindings to Ada.

Knockyo
=======

- **Description:** A toy built with "Arduino" and "Murata" sensors.
- **Year:** 2015
- **Source:** TBD
- **Partners:** Evyatar Tamir, Daniel Zhitomirskii, Nadav Weiss

This is a toy that was developed during a hackathon sponsored by “Murata”, a Japanese hardware manufacturer. 
We used an **Arduino** with sensors produced by Murata to create a rhythm practice toy. 
After the toy plays a sound pattern, the player has to tap on the mini drum in order to reproduce the same pattern. The accuracy of the reproduction determined the score which is displayed on a neopixel ring. Light sensor is used for hand gesture input commands such as starting a game or recording a custom sequence. Murata's shock sensor is concelaed in the drum.

Iava
====

- **Description:** Developing a custom language called Iava
- **Year:** 2012
- **Source:** `Main project </files/project_images/IAVA.tar.gz>`_, `Eclipse plugin </files/project_images/IAVA_Plugin.tar.gz>`_
- **Partners:** Hadar Sivan, Alex Ilgayev, Alex Prutkov, Shai Barad, Pavel Kharakh, Bar Weiner, Arnon Yogev

This can be considered the final software engineering course.
 
In this project we developed a custom language that has similar but simpler syntax as Java. We developed the "whole package": compiler, standard library, an **Eclipse plugin** and a manual.

The focus of this project was not the technology but rather practicing proper software engineering tools and techniques.

We used *Trac* as an issue tracker ----------------------

3D Model Viewer
===============

- **Description:** 3D model viewer developed as part of computer graphics course.
- **Year:** TBD
- **Partners:** Alex Ilgayev

This is a 3D model viewer with many features that demonstrate what we learned during our computer graphics course at the Technion.
