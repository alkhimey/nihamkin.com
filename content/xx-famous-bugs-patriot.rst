Background
----------

February 25th 1991 was one of the last days of the First Gulf War. Saddamâ€™s
forces were retreating from Kuwait. On that day Iraqi army fired a scud missile
towards Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. This was the last Scud to be fired during that
war. And the deadliest. It hit a barracks of US forces stationed near Dhahran.
28 american soldiers died and more than 100 were wounded. 

A MIM-104 "Patriot" surface to air missile system was protecting that site.
During the first gulf war that system had very low success rates, 50% in Israel
and 80% in Saudi Arabia. However, this incident was different. The failure to
intercept and even to fire at the incoming scud was caused by a software error.

Fixed Point
-----------

Before explaining about what caused the Patriot system to loose track of the
incoming missile, we need to understand few basic concepts. The firs of which is
how real numbers can be encoded in computer memory.

Eery software developer knows what a floating point representation is.
