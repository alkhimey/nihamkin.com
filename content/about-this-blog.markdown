## Welcome!

My name is Artium Nihamkin and I am a software engineer from Israel.

This is my personal blog where I plan to publish interesting and usefull stuff that I encounter during my endeavor in my proffesional and personal life. 

Some of the things you might find here are:

 - Articles related to software developer.
 - Problems and solutions for various technical problems that I have personally encountered.
 - Philosophical monologues.
 - Discoveries in the world of hobby robotics.
 - Links to interesting information in other blogs.

I do not expect people to follow my blog closely. My expectations are that individual posts will be discovered through various google searches.
