It is always good to cut on household expences, especially at times when product prices are rising and salaries are shrinking. In this post I have gathered several tips that will help you save money monthly with only small impact on your quality of life.

Notice that this post is intented to help Israeli resident (which I am part of) and will not be too much usefull for visitors and tourists. 

#### Cellphone Bills ####
Thaks to the cellphone market reform the prices today are quite fair. Yet many people are not aware of this and still pay for the older plans. New physical and virtual carriers offer "unlimited plans" for a price of 90-100 NIS per month. Some of the older carriers offer similar plans as wll.

If you do not use the phone very often you can reduce the bill even further by choosing a "pay per minute" plan. You need to look at your previous bills and see how much you minutes talk each month. Then calculate the price you will pay for these minutes in the pay per minute plans and decide which plan is cheaper for you. 

I recently switched my family to Golan Telecom. My mother used to pay 100-110 NIS per month for her calls. Now she pays 10 NIS for her plan that grants her 60 minutes and 60 sms per month and on avarage she pays additional 20 NIS for addional minutes. That is an instant 70 NIS saving. 

#### Telephone Bills ####
Personaly, we still keep a Bezeq landline at our home, but honestly there is absolutely no reason for this. Landlines are rarely used these days and 50 NIS just for the subscription is a too much price to pay when you have mobile unlimited plans. Also notice that contrary to a common belief, according to a new law, if you cancel your landline you will still be able to keep Bezeq as your Internet infrastructure.

#### Television ####


#### Internet ####
The key idea here is to hussle. Research on the Internet for the market price of the speed you want to subscribe to and stick to that number.  

#### Electricity ####

#### Credit Cards ####

#### Bank ####

#### Groceries ####

#### Appliences and Shopping ####


#### Conclusion ####
