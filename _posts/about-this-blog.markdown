## Welcome!

My name is Artium Nihamkin and I am a software engineer from Israel.

This is my personal blog where I plan to publish cool stuff that I encounter during my endeavor in the world wide web. 

Some of the things you might find here are:

 - Articles related to my professional life as a software developer.
 - Problems and solutions for various technical problems that I encounter.
 - Philosophical monologues.
 - Discoveries in the world of hobby robotics.
 - Links to interesting information in other blogs.

I do not expect people to follow my blog closely. My expectations are that people will discover individual posts through a google search. 

You always can reach me by the following email:
