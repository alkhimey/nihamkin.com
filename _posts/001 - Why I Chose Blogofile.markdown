title: Why I Chose Blogofile as my Blogging Platform
---

First of all, what is "Blogofile"? The definition from the original [website](http://www.blogofile.com/) says:
> **Definition: Blogofile (n):** A static website compiler and blog engine, written and extended in Python.

Static website compiler means that each time we want to make an change to the website, it must recompiled, which means to regenerate the html files. The advantage of this is that we host only the generated html files. No special web framework is need. No need for CGI, php or java access on the server. All you need is a web server that can serve static content.

When I studied at the Technion, students received small hosting space where they could host a static only website. Blogofile is perfect for such situations.
